# Numerical Methods

Harvard University AM205: Numerical Methods Fall 2018. The class is primarily for graduate students in Applied Mathematics and provides a survey of numerical strategies for complex problems. The repository is separated into Problem Sets and the Final Project \[for the sake of Academic Honesty, I am not including the midterm examination\].
